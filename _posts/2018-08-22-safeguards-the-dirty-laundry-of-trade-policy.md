U.S. consumers love choices. But, choice in the U.S. market means American manufacturers face stiff competition at home and abroad.  Take washing machines for example. Some washing machines are front-loading, some are top-loading. Machines hold different sized loads and use different amounts of water. Some take longer per load than others. Some have auto soap dispensers, and some are even “smart” enough to let you tell Amazon’s Alexa to “start the wash." It's competitive.  In January 2018, President Trump approved a safeguard on washing machine manufacturers in the U.S. However, what temporarily helps a producer likely won't help the American consumer.
