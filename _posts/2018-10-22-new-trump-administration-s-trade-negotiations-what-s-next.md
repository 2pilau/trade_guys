On October 16, the Trump administration formally [notified ](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/october/trump-administration-announces)Congress that it intends to negotiate trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. The formal notifications carry significance even though negotiations with each of the three governments had already been announced, albeit less formally. By notifying Congress, the administration has bound itself to the procedures laid out in the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) law. TPA requires the administration to follow congressional negotiating objectives contained in the law and to consult with Congress throughout the negotiation. In return, trade agreements submitted to Congress under TPA cannot be amended and are subject only to an up or down vote.
