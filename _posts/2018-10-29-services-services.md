Our [Trade Guys podcast](https://www.csis.org/podcasts/trade-guys) was fortunate last week to have Christine Bliss as our guest. She is president of the Coalition of Service Industries (CSI), the main organization in town representing services companies. Before coming to CSI, she was assistant U.S. trade representative for services, investment, telecommunication, and e-commerce, responsible for overseeing all multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations and policy issues in those areas for the agency. She also served as the lead U.S. negotiator in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Services Negotiations. So, she’s been doing services for a long time and knows what she’s talking about.
