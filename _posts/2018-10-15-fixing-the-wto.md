excerpt: 'CSIS was privileged last week to host the U.S. ambassador to the World Trade
  Organization (WTO), Dennis Shea, for a public conversation. Ambassador Shea did
  not make front page news, no doubt much to his relief. No surprise there. Even in
  the best of circumstances, the WTO rarely makes the front page, and we are hardly
  in the best of circumstances. He did, however, do an excellent job of both defending
  and explaining the administration''s policy toward the organization.   '
