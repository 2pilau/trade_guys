The Trump administration opened a new chapter in its trade war with China this week, announcing that it will impose a 10 percent tariff on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 24. Those tariffs will hike up to 25 percent on January 1, 2019, if China does not meet U.S. demands. Beijing has pledged to fire back with tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports.

Once the next tranche of tariffs are imposed, 6,832 Chinese products and 6,411 U.S. products will be covered.
