excerpt: On November 6, voters flipped the House of Representatives away from Republican
  control into the hands of Democratic members. Republicans managed to strengthen
  their grip on the Senate. These developments will have implications for the administration’s
  trade policy agenda, although some questions remain given the evolving and unconventional
  political dynamics surrounding the issue.
