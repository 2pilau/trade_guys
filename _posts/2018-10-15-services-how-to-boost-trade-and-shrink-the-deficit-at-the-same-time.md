Chances are you do not work in agriculture or in manufacturing. In fact, [four out of five jobs](https://ustr.gov/TiSA) in the United States are in “services,” and [75 percent](https://ustr.gov/TiSA) of U.S. GDP is derived from services. Worldwide, the numbers are only slightly less impressive. [A majority ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.SRV.EMPL.ZS)of global employment is also in services. Roughly [a quarter](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS) of the world works in agriculture [and slightly less ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.IND.EMPL.ZS)in manufacturing. In the United States, the numbers are much smaller: as of 2015, only [1.63 percent ](https://ourworldindata.org/employment-in-agriculture)of the U.S. labor force worked in agriculture.
