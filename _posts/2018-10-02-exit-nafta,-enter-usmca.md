excerpt: It is somewhat comforting to see that one of the worst things you can say
  about U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is that the new trade agreement replaces
  a term that everyone knows and can say with an unpronounceable acronym. How do you
  say USMCA? Even NAFTA 2.0 would sound better. Hard to pronounce though it may be,
  if that’s the worst one can say about the agreement, then the business communities
  in all three countries dodged a serious bullet.
