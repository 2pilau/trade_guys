excerpt: 'What happened with NAFTA last week? The United States and Canada did not
  reach agreement; the administration notified Congress anyway of its intent to sign
  an agreement, at least with Mexico and perhaps with Canada later; the parties said
  surprisingly nice things about each other (except for our president who was rude
  as usual) and agreed to meet again this week. So, what does it all mean?  '
