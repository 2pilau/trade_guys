excerpt: There is no question that the president has reframed the debate on trade
  in the United States. As I have said many times, after 30 years below the fold in
  the business section (for you, millennials, thatâ€™s a reference to old-fashioned
  newspapers), trade is now on the front page every day. As it turns out, that has
  had both good and bad consequences.
