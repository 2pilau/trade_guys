excerpt: President Trump’s decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs and his threat
  to put tariffs on automobiles and parts [under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion
  Act of 1962 ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-adjusting-imports-steel-united-states/)have
  generated anxiety on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers have expressed concern about the economic
  impact of the tariffs as well as the legal foundation for them.  Some have suggested
  reining in the president's tariff authority. What has been proposed, what are the
  chances meaningful action is taken, and is it a good idea for Congress  to take
  back trade authority from the president?
