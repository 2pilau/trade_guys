I"ñ<p>The U.S. and Mexico have reached a preliminary agreement in principle on a range of bilateral trade issues. The Trump administration is ready to submit that deal to Congress regardless of whether Canada gets on board. What does this mean for NAFTA and the U.S. trade relationship with Canada? Whatâ€™s in the U.S.-Mexico agreement and what issues still have to be worked out between the three countries? Is the U.S. headed for a breakup with its northern neighbor or a closer relationship?</p>
