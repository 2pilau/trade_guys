I"m<p>Chances are you do not work in agriculture or in manufacturing. In fact, <a href="https://ustr.gov/TiSA">four out of five jobs</a> in the United States are in “services,” and <a href="https://ustr.gov/TiSA">75 percent</a> of U.S. GDP is derived from services. Worldwide, the numbers are only slightly less impressive. <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.SRV.EMPL.ZS">A majority </a>of global employment is also in services. Roughly <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS">a quarter</a> of the world works in agriculture <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.IND.EMPL.ZS">and slightly less </a>in manufacturing. In the United States, the numbers are much smaller: as of 2015, only <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/employment-in-agriculture">1.63 percent </a>of the U.S. labor force worked in agriculture.</p>
