The U.S.-China trade war doesn’t let up. The Trade Guys tackle how the latest tranche of tariffs are affecting American businesses and Congress. Plus, the U.S. and Mexico seem to be progressing with NAFTA talks, but where is Canada?

## What We're Reading
### &quot;China Meets trump&#39;s Tariff Hardball With Pledge to Endure&quot;
[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/china-prepared-for-long-trade-war-with-u-s-state-media-says)

&quot;After a weekend of claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that he has the upper hand in the trade war with China, Beijing responded through state media by saying the nation is ready to endure the economic fallout.&quot;

**Why it matters:** Neither the U.S. or China show any sign of backing down even as the two countries continue to exchange tariff threats and move to implement more duties.

**Key question:** Has the trade war escalated to a point where the political costs of backing down are too high for either country to consider?

### &quot;Fairfield losing another 126 jobs after TV-maker closes plant, citing Trump tariffs&quot;
[The State](https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article216196580.html)

&quot;Beleaguered Fairfield County is losing another 126 jobs after TV-maker Element Electronics said Monday it will close its Winnsboro plant in response to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.&quot;

**Why it matters:** President Trump and his advisors have said U.S. companies may have to deal with some pain and wait out his tariffs and foreign retaliation while the U.S. negotiates fairer trade arrangements. But some companies caught in the crossfire of the trade war are having trouble staying afloat.

**Key question:** Should the Trump administration be offering assistance to companies harmed by the trade war?

### &quot;Foreign affairs minister &#39;very keen&#39; to quickly wrap up NAFTA&quot;

&quot;Canada&#39;s foreign affairs minister says she&#39;s &#39;very keen&#39; to wrap up NAFTA renegotiations after sitting out the last round of talks between the U.S. and Mexico.&quot;

&quot;However, Canada wasn&#39;t part of Friday&#39;s talks between U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo in Washington, D.C.&quot;

**Why it matters:** The U.S. and Mexico are pushing to reach a NAFTA deal by the end of the month and are reportedly close to a deal on auto rules of origin. Canada, however, has been left out of recent talks.

**Key question:** Will the Trump administration&#39;s ploy to bring Canada into the NAFTA talks only after it strikes a deal with Mexico work to its advantage?

### &quot;Steel Giants With Ties to Trump Officials Block Tariff Relief for Hundreds of Firms&quot;
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/politics/nucor-us-steel-tariff-exemptions.html)

&quot;Two of America&#39;s biggest steel manufacturers — both with deep ties to administration officials — have successfully objected to hundreds of requests by American companies that buy foreign steel to exempt themselves from President Trump&#39;s stiff metal tariffs. They have argued that the imported products are readily available from American steel manufacturers.&quot;

**Why it matters:** U.S. steel manufacturers appear to all but controlling the exemption process run by the Commerce Department, which is supposed to be based on objective criteria.

**Key question:** What are the implications of the industry that the tariffs are supposed to help essentially having veto power over exemptions?
